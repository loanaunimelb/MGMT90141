        <h2>The Story</h2>
        <span class="info">Parkville Tablet Corporation (PTC) wants to develop a new handheld device for office and university based users. PTC commissioned preliminary product development study to understand its development options and 3 different projects were outlined: one with 5 product features, one with 10 features, and one with 20 features. The financial success of the project depends upon the product features of the handheld device and the chance event concerning the demand for the handheld device.

            When asked about the possible demand for the handheld in the electronic device industry, PTCâ€™s CEO talked about a wide range of possibilities given the uncertainty in the tech industry, but decided that it would be adequate to consider two chance event outcomes: a strong demand and a weak demand.
